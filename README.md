## Problem: 	
A veterinary hospital is currently feeling overworked. The hospital is a general practice however they also see emergency appointments for their own clients. These emergency appointments appear to be unpredictable and cause a lot of time/stress for the staff. Managers are wondering if there are any trends to when these appointments come in.

## Goal: 	
Identify any trends for the hospital regarding emergency appointments so management can plan accordinly.

## Privacy: 	
Seeing as this process will be listed publicaly once completed, names of the hospital, clients, and patients have been removed.

## Data: 	
The hospital uses a program called "cornerstone" (which is made by a company called "Idexx") which keeps all the data that will be used for this project. Information includes appointment type, time checked in, preferred doctor (which in the report is simply a number for privacy sake), etc. There were several changes in hospital structure/schedule but they have been fairly steady for around a year. It was decided to collect data from June 1st 2022-June 1st 2023.

##Stakeholders: 	
Hospital owner and office manager. Findings will likely just be shared with office manager but may include both.

##Deliverable: 	
Analysis identifying any trends in regards to emergency appointments so the hospital can plan accordingly.

## Program to use:
